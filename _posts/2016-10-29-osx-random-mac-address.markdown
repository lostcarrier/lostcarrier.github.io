The only data your browser should *ever* send OUT, is the http request when first accessing a web page.

I cannot see ANY reason whatsoever for my browser to tell a website (which is an ascii text document parsed by the browser) anything at all about my system, my browsing habits, my location, my screen size, my battery life, or anything else at all except what web page I am requesting.

Is there a browser that respects TOTAL privacy? That out-of-the-box sets NO cookies, sends NO data except the request, and displays images natively?
